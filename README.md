### What's new in v2.0 ?

This Update is not for UI! :(
But this Update is very useful for programmers because :
    
    - I added Contexts to project!
    - I added Reducers to minify app component ! 

Now app development is much easier!

### What this app can to do ?

This Project will help to manage your users.\
This project abilities are :

    - Add User to a Table!
    - Modify Users you have already before!
    - Delete Users you have already Before!
    - save users in localStorage!
    - Having simple & beautiful UI !

But this Project has some disabilities too, like :

    - There is no validation for inputs!
    - There is no help in project!
    - There is no darkmode for project!
    - There is only one view to see users!
    - Only one man can use project!

Help me to make this project better! :)
And for the last word ...\
